# Stream Deck Scripts for macOS

These are scripts I have been developing for Elgato's Stream Deck for my own use on macOS. 

## Requirements to use
For many of these scripts to work you need to copy `Resources/Utils.scptd` to `~/Library/Script Libraries`, unfortunately because this is where macOS [JAX _(JavaScript for Applications)_](https://github.com/JXA-Cookbook/JXA-Cookbook/wiki) looks for it.

With the root directory of this repo as your current directory in terminal:

``` 
cp -R Resources/Utils.scptd ~/Library/Script\ Libraries
```


**If you are with Elgato**, please [email me](mailto:mike@newclarity.net?subject=From+Elgato+about+Stream+Deck+Scripts) as I have things that would make writing these scripts easier and that should be simple for you to fix..
